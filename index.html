                    I'm a 4th-year IT student, venturing into the depths of logic and architecture.
                    Currently, I'm learning clean architecture with Flutter and backend development with Java Spring Boot - aiming for a more modular, structured, and testable approach of software development.
                    I also have a modest background in mobile and desktop development.

                <h2 class="section-title">Journey: How It All Began? From A Simple Curiosity to an Endless Pursuit of
                    Learning</h2>
                <p class="journey-text">
                    My development journey began in Senior High School, where I first learned about programming -
                    thinking it would be somehow easier because I had prior knowledge about computers… or so I thought.
                    <br><br>
                    Funny enough, the learning wasn’t smooth sailing. Before classes began, we had this one-day
                    event (some kind of career development or assessment thingy), and I picked “Programming” out of
                    curiosity. The task? Create a console-based app in Java. At that time, I had no idea what I was
                    supposed to do, so I started typing some random words - literally gibberish - like I was writing out
                    what I wanted the app to do. I didn’t know a thing about coding, what it looked like, or even what a
                    console-based app was. Looking back now, it’s kinda hilarious - but that moment was one of the
                    reason why I got hooked into coding.
                    <br><br>
                    I still remember the feeling of excitement and confusion when I saw my first "Hello World" program
                    executed successfully. At first, those two words alone felt like another piece of text, often used as an
                    introductory message whenever we learn a new programming language. But everything changed as I learn
                    more about programming, and those two words that I consider as an introductory message became a symbol 
                    of endless possibilities. They marked the beginning of a journey filled with challenges, creativity, 
                    and growth. Each new project presented learning; bug, and solution added to my understanding and passion for 
                    software development.
                    <br><br>
                    Fast forward, our curriculum introduced Java as our first programming language, and I quickly fell in love with
                    OOP. I started with simple console based-apps to GUI with Swing, and eventually tried JavaFx with
                    JDBC. It was a challenging experience, largely due to JavaFX’s steep learning curve and limited
                    resources available, but I still managed to navigate through it and built the CRUD application.
                    <br><br>
                    After that came C#, which gave me a deeper understanding of OOP, working with databases, and a
                    glimpse into software design principles. During my 2nd year, I build a Loan Management System using
                    C# and MS SQL Server. It took countless tutorials, sleepless nights, and introduced me to things
                    like database normalization, frontend frameworks like Guna, and concepts like factory constructors.
                    <br><br>
                    Later on, a friend introduced me to Flutter - a cross-platform framework by Google. Just like
                    before, learning Flutter wasn’t easy, especially since I barely knew anything about frontend
                    development. It felt like navigating to an uncharted territory. But as I kept going, Flutter helped
                    solidify my foundation in software development. I learned how to build UI from scratch, refactor
                    codes into reusable widgets, handle navigation using Navigator and GoRouter, integrate APIs using
                    asynchronous programming and the HTTP protocol, manage state with Bloc, and apply software design
                    principles like Clean architecture for a more modular, structured, and testable approach of software
                    development.
                    <br><br>
                    Throughout this journey, I built a QR-based Item Tracking and Inventory Management System as part of
                    our capstone project. It was also my first time diving deep into backend development, and I used
                    Dart Frog to build the API that powered the system. That experience broaden my understanding of
                    backend concepts like routing, middleware, session handling, and authentication.
                    <br><br>
                    Recently, I’ve been honing my backend skills by exploring Node.js with Typescript, Prisma,
                    PostgreSQL, and Express. I’ve started building a simple server for a finance tracker app I plan to
                    develop next - continuing that endless pursuit I started all the way back with a few lines of
                    gibberish.
